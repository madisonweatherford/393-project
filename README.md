# 393-project
Final project for Madison Weatherford, Karenna Hunt, and Kristen Chan. 
This project is a database with information about students at Cal Poly who use the Disability Resource Center. This data is fake and these students in the dataset don't necessarily utilize the DRC. 

Group Members: Kristen Chan, Karenna Hunt, Madison Weatherford
BUS 393-01



State Assumptions:

All DRC student classes are automatically registered with the DRC, they cannot choose which classes are taken with the DRC and which aren’t. 
The DRC requests a student’s information from Cal Poly when the student registers with the DRC, our database does not have information of all students who attend Cal Poly. 
All exam data is for the current quarter. 
All the tests taken at the DRC are because a student put in a request  with the DRC to take  the test at the DRC. Students do not have to take an exam at the DRC if they are a DRC student, they may take their exam in class.

Statement of Understanding:

The DRC needs more money to support its students, so they need to create reports to answer specific questions for Cal Poly about the DRC.  The IT department at the DRC tried to create reports using its existing database, but they realized their data is extremely messy and the database is not functional. So, the DRC has tasked Madison, Kristen, and Karenna (former DRC employees) to clean their data and create a new, functional database to identify areas of the DRC’s services where they need to better support their students.   

Why We Deserve Extra Credit:

Our group used a real life applicable example pertaining to a place that all group members have a thorough understanding of.  Kristen and Karenna both currently work there as test proctors and Madison has done a past project working with them (not database related). 
In addition to the real life problem, we worked to make the project as real as possible using real data. The students in our database were pulled from the Cal Poly Directory (public information, not students who necessarily utilize the DRC), actual current professors, and actual classes.  Though our database does not account for every student and every faculty member, we kept all proportions similar to what it would be in real life.  We scaled down the number of students who actually use the DRC (about 1500 out of 20,000 total students), the number of teaching faculty (1500), and the number of classes (an estimate because Cal Poly does not state outright how many classes are offered) 1000 down by a factor of 100. 
Lastly, we utilized Github, a professional version control system to promote team wide collaboration.  One member of our group had briefly learned about it and its applications in a past class and suggested it as a way to store our documents if we wanted to collaborate remotely.  Using Github we believe is a great way to make our project publically available and easily submittable (rather a link than a zipfile).  Additionally, we thought having a Github repository where we could easily show recruiters and job interviewers a past project that involved SQL would help us stand out in the job market, showcasing both our project and that we have learned the basic functions of Github, a widely used platform in professions involving coding.  Learning this platform that was new to most of our group (and new for everyone using Linux). It was a valuable skill that we were able to develop during this project but required extra time and troubleshooting that we would not have needed to take if we did not try to learn Github during the course of our project. We really enjoyed learning it!
